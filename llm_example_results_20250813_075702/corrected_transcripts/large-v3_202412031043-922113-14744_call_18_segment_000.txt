Yes, sir. It's going to be a small fire due to a lawnmower running over a leaf blower. Fire's out. Ladder 2 can handle you. Clear all additional units. You're going to handle this. All these clear. You need the tech? Momentarily. DL to Peach. Both units are accounted for. All right. UMS Rueben. You're good. UMS 3. All UMS assets have been cleared from Hago. You've chosen Rolo. All right.
