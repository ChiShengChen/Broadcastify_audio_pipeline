Commander Ladder 2, what's the status of primaries? I have a theory that the primary is on the right floor. I'll update you shortly. Copy. Comment stated there's possibly a patient on oxygen inside. 19-20. We're on fire. Second floor in extension. Inside the room, we're going to start pulling some ceilings. We understand there's still possibly one more individual in this area. You got it.
