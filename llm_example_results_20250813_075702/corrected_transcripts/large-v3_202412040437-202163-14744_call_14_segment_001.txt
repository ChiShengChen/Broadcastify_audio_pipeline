Good, Engine 1. Yes, we are up in the mezzanine area. We are located in the HVAC system. We have a chiller of some kind. We have light smoke coming from it. It is not on fire at this time. We will isolate the power to it, and then we can handle with Engine 1 and Ladder 1. Isolated the issue. Engine 1 and Ladder 1. Have Rescue 1 coming inside as well. All of the units can clear.
