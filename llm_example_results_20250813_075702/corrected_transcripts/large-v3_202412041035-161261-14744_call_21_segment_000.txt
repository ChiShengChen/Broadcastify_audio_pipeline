The city is asking if you move your vehicle out of the way so they can free up that lane of travel. Copy. Copy. Units, go ahead and dissolve command and clear the attack. Copy. Copy, all units on attack. Boleynack is going to be open, I believe, with one, possibly two lanes until they can get the accident clear up. I'm sorry, you said that was westbound on the bull run?
