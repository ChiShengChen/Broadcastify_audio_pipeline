Command to Engine 18, will you call me? Negative, I was just talking to the AT driver. Received. I'm going to dissolve command and leave the attack with you. Sounds good, thank you. Thank you. Copy that, Engine 4, 923. When you get on the bridge, you're going to have to go all the way down the first tunnel, hang a right before you go through the tunnel, drive all the way around, get headed back in the southbound direction. You'll see the accident on your left-hand side as you pass.
