Command Engine 14. East side, go ahead. Okay, that's what I was checking. Do we need to get another crew for the west side that I copied earlier? Geographically challenged. I'm on the west side. We're extending a line right now. I think we have adequate manpower at the time. Okay, that's what I was checking. So you got the west side and then Engine 11 has the east side. I also have Rush 8 that just arrived on scene if you need him. Flappers, you can grab some line on the way in. The east side is pretty much mocked up for now. We're going to start making our way west to assist Engine 14 and reposition host. Command copied. Command Rush 8. Engine 11, command. Command. Have Engine 8 see if they can get that Rush truck along the railroad track. So they can get a little bit further west. They might be able to drop a line at the end over there. Yeah, just have Rush 8 and Support 8 here. Volunteers. Okay. We're back in there. Okay. We're back in there. Okay. We're back in there. Okay. We're back in there. Okay. We're back in there. Okay. Okay. Okay.
