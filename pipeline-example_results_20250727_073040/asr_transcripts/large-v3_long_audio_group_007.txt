I'm trying to contact the Ministry of Local Office 605, Presidential Boulevard, Agent 16. Agent 18. 21. 21B. That's 4. Agent 16, perlis, G-10, copy. Copy. Agent 18. Command, Agent 14. East side, go ahead. I was checking. Do we need to get another crew for the west side? That was what I copied earlier. Geographically challenged. I'm on the west side. We're extending a line right now. I think we have adequate manpower at the time. Okay, that's what I was checking. So you got the west side, and then Agent 11 has the east side. I also have a brush 8 that just arrived on scene if you need him. And grab some line on the way in. The east side is pretty much mocked up for now. We're going to start making our way west to assist Agent 14 and reposition those. Command, copy. Command, brush 8. Get him to go face-to-face with me. That was what I was going to request. Agent 11, command. Agent 8, see if they can get that brush truck along the railroad track so they can get a little bit further west. They might be able to drop a line at the end over there. Brush 8 and support 8 here. There's volunteers in there. Agent 14, 16. I can go ahead and assume command. I see that you have an end line down. Say you have your own motor supply, correct? Yeah, you have engine 3. He's got a 1. Command to Fire Rescue 1 to check any of the surrounding structures. No structures that are in any threat. 11-9-20 en route for an illness of 449 Revere Drive. 89-year-old female this week. He's almost fallen. 10-17.
