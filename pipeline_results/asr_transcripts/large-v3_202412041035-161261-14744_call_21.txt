If you move your vehicle, enable the trip that lane of travel. Copy. And dissolve the command. I'm going to be open, I believe, with one, possibly two lanes, so we can get the accident cleared out. I'm sorry, you said that was Westbound on the boulevard? Yeah, Westbound on the boulevard, just right out of Willamette. Two lanes are possible. They just have two, possibly three. We're going to be close. Okay, I'll pass.
