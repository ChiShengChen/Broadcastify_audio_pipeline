Maybe shame on five hundred and twenty p. We're double checking with the color, but I have another prior from back in August. That's the code three, five, four, one. We'll try it three, five, four, one. It doesn't seem like anything's worse since we got here. There's just a light haze in there. We check all the mechanical room and control room on the first floor. She's before we get to the second floor and check out above it. We haven't found anything yet. We're gonna try and find somebody here to see if they actually had this smoke or just lazy. I think somewhere in the bezzanine area located in each vestibule area, we've got light smoke coming. I'm gonna isolate power to one and ladder one. We're gonna do issue. We've got one and ladder one. We've got rescue one coming inside too. All we're gonna do is can we clear.
