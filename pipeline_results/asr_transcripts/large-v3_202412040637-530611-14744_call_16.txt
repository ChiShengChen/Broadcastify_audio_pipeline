She's kind of got the two holes. Yeah, I've got the two holes. I've got AMOS 422P available. One's going to be all the way up near the 4th Precinct area, north, and then we've got the 440 North Glenhaven. Now it's in the charity hall at Kingsbury now. To every way, I should have another AMOS coming out of Station 4. This regards a lot. She's just clear. They can take every 422P. Take North Glenhaven. That should go perfectly. AMOS 422P, you're going to be taking North Glenhaven. AMOS 422P, you'll be taking Avery. Is that correct? Uh, 210.
