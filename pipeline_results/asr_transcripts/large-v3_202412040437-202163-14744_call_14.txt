We're gonna be shaming on 520P. We're double checking with the caller, but I have another prior from back in August. It says the code's 3541. We'll try 3541. It doesn't seem like anything's worse since we got here. There's just a light haze in there. We checked all the mechanical room and control room on the first floor. We're gonna go to the second floor and check out above it. We haven't found anything yet. We're gonna try to find somebody here to see if they actually had this smoke or just laid it in. We're in the mezzanine area. Located in each regular. We got light smoke coming from the bottom. We're gonna isolate power to one in ladder one. We got rescue one coming inside too. All units can be cleared.
