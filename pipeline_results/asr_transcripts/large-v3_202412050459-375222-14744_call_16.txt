East side, go ahead. Do we need to get another crew for the west side? That was a topic earlier. Challenge. I'm on the west side. We're extending the line right now. I think we have Addison and Manpower at the time. That's what I was checking. So you got the west side and then Angelo has the east side. I also have a brush 8 that just arrived on scene, if you need him. You can grab some line on the way. The east side is pretty much mopped up. We can start making our way west to assist it. Gene, can you reposition how it is? You made a brush 8. Can we do a face-to-face with you? That's what I was going to request. Engine 11. Engine 8, do you think you can get that brush truck along the railroad track? If they can get a little bit further west, they might be able to drop a line at the end over there. 4-8, here. Just volunteers.
