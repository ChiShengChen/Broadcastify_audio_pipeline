East side, go ahead. Do we need to get another crew for the west side? That was I talking earlier. Challenge. I'm on the west side. We're extending the line right now. I think we have adequate manpower at the time. That's what I'll check. So you got the west side and then, uh, Angela Eleven has the east side. We also have, uh, Rush Eight that just arrived on scene if you need 'em. We can grab some line on the way. The east side's pretty much mopped up. We can start making our way west to assisting team and reposition how we made Rush Eight. Can we do a face to face with you? Just while I was scanning for question. Angela Eleven, question. Angela Eight, do you think you've got Rush Truck along the, uh, the railroad track? Like you need a little bit further west? You might be able to drop a line into the end over there. Four, eight, yeah. Volunteers.
