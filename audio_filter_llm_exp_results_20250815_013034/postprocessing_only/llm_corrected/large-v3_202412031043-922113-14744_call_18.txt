Yes, sir, it’s a small fire due to a lawnmower hitting a pile of leaves. The fire is out; Ladder 2 can handle you now. Clear all additional units. You’ll handle this one, and you need the tech? Just a moment. DL to Peach, both units are accounted for. Over. UMS Rubin, you’re good. UMS 3. All UMS assets have been cleared from Hagos, we’ve chosen Raven. Sir, please consult this before you arrest Beven, who is accused of being involved in a “knot-and-run” incident involving a pre-teen girl who was abducted and found loose outside her home after being held captive for several hours. I would like you to compute a note that in order to conduct the inspection for them, brake assembly checks should be done on Satori, Aria, and Rae. Yes. Ray, thank you.
