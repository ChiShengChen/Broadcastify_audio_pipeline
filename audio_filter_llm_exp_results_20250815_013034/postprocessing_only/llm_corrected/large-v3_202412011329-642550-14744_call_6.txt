For G-Mage. Please, Ken. 923P will be clearing from Central in a moment. You can clear 621 and assign 923P to Jesus. Spencer, you copy the hold call on Aragon and I just got a call at VB Psych. I did, and I am working to try to get some ambulance to clear it up. Well, you may need the U621, so let me try one more ambulance. Yes, sir. 1446. Virginia Beach. That's just my two. You can clear EMS. It's going to be a police match. When you get a chance, you give me an ETA on that one. Yes, sir. 621P, you copy. 621P, we thought we were clear. We're coming up, Ken. Then I'll give you a call and just a second. 1447.
