Commander Ladder 2, what's the status of primaries? I have a theory that the primary is on the right floor. I'll update you shortly. Copy. Comment stated there's possibly a occupant on oxygen interior. 19-20. We're on fire. Second fire in extension. Inside the room, we're going to start pulling some ceilings. We understand there's still possibly one more individual in this area. You got it. Over by where we're parked. You guys in my site. We're making patient contact. Just stand by for a second. Will do. With everybody outside. Second fire prep. Horizontal 1-9-10. Fixed. 2nd statements. Your unit is disengaged. Stop. 3-6-1.
