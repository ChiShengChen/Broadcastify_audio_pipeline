Engine 7 to Ladder 7 on TAC-4. Ladder 7. I'm not sure if they've updated your case. These are still the same cases. So we have units on TAC-3 and units on TAC-4. If you're in a good position, I can clear Ladder 16. Yeah, I'm arriving now. Go ahead and clear Ladder 16. Channel is assigned to our call. Is that correct? We have TAC-3 and 4? It's because it was initially entered as two separate cases until we were able to confirm they were related. So if everyone wants to go to TAC-3, it's all the same accident. Okay, copy that. I appreciate it. I will let all the units on TAC-4 know to switch to TAC-3. 16-40. Do they have enough manpower on scene? 16 copies. We're clear.
