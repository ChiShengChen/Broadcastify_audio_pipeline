The city is requesting that you move your vehicle out of the way so that they can free up that lane of travel. Copy. Copy. Units, go ahead and dissolve command and clear the attack. Copy. Copy, all units on attack. Boleynack is going to be open, I believe, with one, possibly two lanes until they can get the accident cleared up. I'm sorry, you said that was westbound on the boulevard? Yeah, westbound on Boleynack, just right at Little Neck. Two lanes are possible, they just have two, possibly three are going to be closed. 12-0-5.
