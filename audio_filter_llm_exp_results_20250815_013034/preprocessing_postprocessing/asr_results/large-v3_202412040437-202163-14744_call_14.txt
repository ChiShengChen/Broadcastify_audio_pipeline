going to be shame on 520p. We're double checking with the caller, but I have another prior from back in August that says the code is 3541. Copy. We'll try 3541. 10-4, it's 523. It doesn't seem like anything's worse since we got here. There's just a light haze in the pool there. We checked all the mechanical room and fire control room on the first floor. Engine 4 is here on the second floor and check out above it, but we haven't found anything yet. We're trying to find somebody here to see if they actually have good smoke or just lazy smoke. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Yeah, we're up in the mezzanine area. We're located in HVAC. We're a chiller of some kind. We got light smoke coming from it. It's not on fire at this time. We're going to isolate power to it and then we can handle with Engine 1 and Ladder 1. Isolated the issue. Engine 1 and Ladder 1. Got Rescue 1 coming inside too. All of the units can clear.
