E18, this is Battalion Chief 101. I need you to respond. Negative, I am currently speaking with the AT driver. Okay, stand by. I am releasing command and leaving the incident to you. Understood, thank you. Thank you. This is Engine 4, 923. Upon arrival on the bridge, you will have to travel all the way down the first tunnel, make a right before entering the second tunnel, continue driving until you turn around in a southerly direction. The accident will be on your left as you pass.
