EMS 1, do you copy? This is EMS 2. What's the status of primaries? I have a theory that the primary is on the right floor. I'll update you shortly. Acknowledge. The patient is on oxygen. 19-20. We're on fire. There's a second fire in extension. Inside the room, we're going to start pulling some ceilings. We understand there's still possibly one more individual in this area. Understood.
