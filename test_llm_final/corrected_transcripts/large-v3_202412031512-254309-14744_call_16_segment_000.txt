Do not charge the line. G20 is arriving on scene. The second engine. Hey, command copy, G20. You will be water supply. Goodnight, rescue team. Hey, Chief. No extension to the house. Engine 3 and Ladder 10 can handle it. Request you to. You got any for EMS? No, sir. All right, command. I'm gonna leave you to tag. Engine 20, you can clear. All units, except for Ladder 10, Engine 3, and Rescue 2, you can clear. Clear, 20.
