Going to be Sham 520P. We're double checking with the caller, but I have another prior from back in August that says the code is 3541. Copy. We'll try 3541. 10-4, it's 523. It doesn't seem like anything's worse since we got here. There's just a light haze in the pool there. We checked all the mechanical rooms and fire control rooms on the first floor. Engine 4 is here on the second floor and checked out above it, but we haven't found anything yet. We're trying to find somebody here to see if they actually have good smoke or just lazy smoke. Good afternoon. Good afternoon.
