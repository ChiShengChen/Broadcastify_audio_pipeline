I have these recent tail sheets on the table. That's right, 1723. She's on the road. Engine 18 of Italian 3. Go ahead, 18. On scene. We got a gunshot wound. We got enough to show and go ahead and pass command to you. We'll be out investigating at Tower General. Italian 3 copies. Italian 3 will be establishing command. 18 is on scene. Commercial established for enough and showing. We'll be out investigating. He's on scene. We'll be stuck in the original. This is war supply. I'll get the connection as well.
