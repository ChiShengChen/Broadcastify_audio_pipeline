EMS 1: This is EMS unit 20. What's the status of the primaries? I have a theory that the primary is on the right floor. I'll update you shortly. Copy. The patient is on oxygen inside the room. 19-20. We're on fire. There's a second fire in extension. Inside the room, we're going to start pulling some ceilings. We understand there's still possibly one more individual in this area. You got it.
