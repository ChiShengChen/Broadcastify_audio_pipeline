E18, this is Base. Will you copy me? Negative, I was just talking to the AT driver. Received. I'm going to dissolve command and leave the attack with you. Sounds good, thanks. Thank you. Copy that, E4, 923. Upon arrival on the bridge, you'll need to turn right at the first tunnel and proceed around the curve. Continue driving south until you reach the scene. The accident will be on your left as you pass.
