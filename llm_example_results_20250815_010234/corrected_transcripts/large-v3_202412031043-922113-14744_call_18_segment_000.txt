This is unit 104, we have a small fire due to a lawnmower running over some leaves. The fire is out. Ladder 2 will handle you. Clear all other units. You'll handle this. Do you need the tech? Just a moment. We've got a code red. Both units are codes. Alright. Unit 89, you're on the air. What's your call sign?
