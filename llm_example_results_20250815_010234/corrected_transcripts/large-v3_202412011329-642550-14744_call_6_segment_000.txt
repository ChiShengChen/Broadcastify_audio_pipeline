For Gerald, please, Ken. Ninety-two-three P will be clearing from Central in a moment. You can clear six-two-one and assign ninety-two-three P to Jesus. Kempfer, you copy this hold on Aragon and I just got a call at VB Psych. I did, and I'm working to try to get some ambulance to clear it up. We may need a U621, so let me try one more ambulance in our lives. Yes, sir. 1446. Virginia Beach. That's just my two. You can clear EMS. The cheetahs are going to be a police match. When you get a chance, you give me an ETA on them. Yes, sir. Six-two-one P, you copy. Six-two-one P, we copy. We're clear. We're coming up, Ken. Ten-four, stand by, and I'll give you a call in just a second.
