Good, Engine 1. Yeah, we're up in the mezzanine area. We're located in HVAC. We're a chiller of some kind. We got light smoke coming from it. It's not on fire at this time. We're gonna isolate power to it and then we can handle with Engine 1 and Ladder 1. Isolated the issue. Engine 1 and Ladder 1. Got Rescue 1 coming inside too. All of the units can clear.
