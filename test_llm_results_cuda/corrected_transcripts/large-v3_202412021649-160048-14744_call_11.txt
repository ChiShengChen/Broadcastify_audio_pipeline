We don't think it's leaking meters, the problem. I think it's something else. Are there any problems in the next area? Negative. It's just the meters and some HVAC outside units. Work was done on the outside. I don't know. We have to ask Ladder 22 about that. I'm talking about the complaint, man. They replaced the tankless water heater.
