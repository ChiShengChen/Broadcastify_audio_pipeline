E18 to base, can you copy? Negative, I was just talking to the AT driver. Received. I'm going to dissolve command and leave the attack with you. Sounds good, thanks. Thanks. Copy that, E4, 923. Upon arrival on the bridge, you will need to travel all the way down the first tunnel, make a right turn before entering the second tunnel, continue driving until you are facing southbound. The accident scene will be on your left as you pass.
