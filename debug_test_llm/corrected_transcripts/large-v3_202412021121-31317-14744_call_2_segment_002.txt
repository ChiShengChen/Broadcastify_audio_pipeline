E18 to base, do you copy? Negative, I was just talking to the AT driver. Received. I'm going to dissolve command and leave the attack with you. Understood, thanks. Thanks. Copy that, Engine 4, 923. Upon arrival on the bridge, you'll need to drive all the way down the first tunnel, make a right at the end of the tunnel, continue driving until you head back in a southbound direction. Accident is on your left as you pass.
