We don't believe it's leaky meters, the issue. I think it's something else. Are there any issues in the next area? Negative. It's just the meters and some HVAC outside units. Work was performed on the outside. I don't know. We've got to ask Ladder 22 about that. I'm speaking to the complaint, man. They replaced the tankless water heater.
