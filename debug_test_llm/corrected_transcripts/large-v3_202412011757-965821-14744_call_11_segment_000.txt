EMS 2 to Base, do you copy? I have a theory that the primary is on the right floor. I'll keep you updated. Confirm. The comment was there may be an occupant on oxygen inside. 19-20. We're on fire. There's a second fire in extension. Inside the room, we're going to begin pulling some ceilings. We understand there might be another person in this area. Understood.
