EMS 19 to Base, do you copy? I have a theory that the primary is on the right floor. I will update you shortly. Confirm. The comment stated there's possibly an occupant on oxygen inside. 19-20. We're on fire. Second fire in extension. Inside the room, we're going to start pulling some ceilings. We understand there's still possibly one more individual in this area. Understood.
