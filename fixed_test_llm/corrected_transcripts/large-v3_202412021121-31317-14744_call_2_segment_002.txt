E18, this is Base 10, do you copy? Negative, I was just talking to the AT driver. Alright, I'm going to dissolve command and leave the attack with you. Understood, thanks. Thanks. 923, Engine 4, this is Base 10. If you get on the bridge, you're gonna have to go all the way down the first tunnel, hang a right before you go through the tunnel, drive all the way around, get headed back in the southbound direction. You'll see the accident on your left-hand side as you pass.
