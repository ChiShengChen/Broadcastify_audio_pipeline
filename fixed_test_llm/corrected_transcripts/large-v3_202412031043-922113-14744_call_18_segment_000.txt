This is unit 302, confirming a small fire due to a lawnmower running over a leaf pile. The fire is out, and Ladder 2 will handle this. Clear all other units. I'll need the tech momentarily. We're code silver on both units, we're codes. All units are clear. This is unit 302, code silver, we have two patients. Unit 302 is big. Unit 303, code silver, we have two patients.
