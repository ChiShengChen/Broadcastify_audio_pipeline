We don't think it's leaky meters; the problem is something else. Are there any problems in the next area? Negative. It's just the meters and some HVAC outside units. Some work was done on the outside. I don't know. We need to check with Ladder 22 about that. I'm talking about the complaint here, man. They replaced the tankless water heater.
