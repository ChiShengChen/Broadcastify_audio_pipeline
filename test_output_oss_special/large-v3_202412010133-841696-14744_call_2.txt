[???] The **?**...??..…..……

We have a transcript that seems unrelated to EMS. It's about a building fire scenario. There's no patient data. So all fields should be empty strings. But maybe some fields like agency, unit etc. We need fill with info from transcript. Let's parse: "Battalion 3" appears, "Engine 7". Agency could be "Massachusetts"? Not specified. Unit: maybe "Engine 7". ETA: none. Age: none. Sex: none. MOI: none. HR: none. RRQ: none. SBP: none. DBP: none. End tidal: none. RR: none. BGL: none. SPO2: none. O2: none. Injuries: none. AO: none. GCS: none. LOC: none. AC: none. Treatment: none. Pregnant: none. Notes: maybe mention "Attic is clear." But notes field optional. Should we include? It says fill only with info explicitly stated. "Attic is clear" is statement but not patient. Could be note. But maybe leave blank. I'd set all to "". Provide JSON accordingly.assistantfinal{"agency":"", "
