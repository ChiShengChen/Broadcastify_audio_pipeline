 360 complete construction throughout. No hazards. I do have a slight odor around the meter on the Bravo side of the structure. Rescue 1, you copy? Rescue 1 driver, can you come forward? Spider 21, come in. What? All regions 4-1 and 4-2, including the garage, are within normal limits. Copy. 1421, call in dispatch. Yes, ma'am. It appears by call notes that this is a life alert activation. Can we just call? Let me know if you have any questions. Make sure that they are aware so that security will let us through, please.
