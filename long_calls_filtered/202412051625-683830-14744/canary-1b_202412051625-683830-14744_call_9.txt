See if you complete somewhere construction throughout. No hazards. I do have a slight odor around the meter on the Bravo side of the structure. Rescue one, come in. Rescue one driver, can you come for us? fourteen twenty one, call and dispatch. Yes ma'am, it appears by call notes that this is a life alert activation. Can we just call Atlantic Shores, make sure that they are aware so that security will let us through please?
