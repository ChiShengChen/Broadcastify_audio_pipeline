Can you show me on five hundred and twenty p? We're double checking with the caller, but I have another prior from back in August. It says the code is three, five, four, one. It doesn't seem like anything's worse since we got here. There's just a light haze in the pool there. We checked all the mechanical room and fire control room on the first floor. And just forced to get to the second floor and check out above it, but we haven't found anything yet. We're gonna try and find somebody here to see if they actually have this smoke or just lazy smoke. I've got rescue one coming inside too. All of the units can clear.
