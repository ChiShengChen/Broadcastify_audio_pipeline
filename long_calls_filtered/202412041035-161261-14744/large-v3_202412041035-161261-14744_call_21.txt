 City's asking if you move your vehicle enable so they can free up that lane of travel. Copy. Copy. Units, go ahead and dissolve command and clear the attack. Copy. Copy, all units on attack. Boleynack is going to be open, I believe, with one, possibly two lanes until they can get the accident clear up. I'm sorry, you said that was westbound on the bull run? Yeah, westbound on Boleynack, just right at Little Neck. Two lanes are possible, they just have two, possibly three are going to be closed. 12-0-5.
