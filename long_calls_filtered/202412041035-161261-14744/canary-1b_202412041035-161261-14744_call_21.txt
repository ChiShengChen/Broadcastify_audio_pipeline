City's asking if you can move your vehicle enable so they can free up that line of travel. Hi, Copy. Little neck is going to be open, I believe with one, possibly two lanes until they can get the accident cleared up. Yeah, West Bound on the Boulevard, just right at Little Neck. Two lanes are packed full. They just have two, possibly three are going to be closed.
