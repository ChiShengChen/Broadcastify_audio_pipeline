 I've got Rescue 1 staged. Do we need them to do any monitoring in the exposure apartments? We're back in the apartment above right now. There's only 11 parks in this apartment. And we're good on the second floor apartment. Alright, so I'm copying. We don't need Rescue 1 for any atmospheric monitoring then? Yeah, or you can clear them up. Copy. What about EMS needs? You can clear your EMS. Also, do you have an official time from dispatch for coming in? I'm going to do it. Alright, official time. Oil Commander, Rescue 1, EMS units and engine 16, you may clear. EMS, do copy. Copy. Copy. Copy. Copy. We're clear.
