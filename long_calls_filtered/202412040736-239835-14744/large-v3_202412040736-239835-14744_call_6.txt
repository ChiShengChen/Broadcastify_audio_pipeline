 to attack four. 28, UMS-4, call your response. 28, Olden Nation has been turned over to fast track and clear that case. Attack four, go ahead and do that. And what do you want to do with the I-100 call sign? Hold that call until at least until we get a unit that's clear from Lee. And now, what other calls come in? And generally, no engines for priority two holds unless requested. 30-46, sir. You just pulled past the I-100. Copy. Thank you, sir.
