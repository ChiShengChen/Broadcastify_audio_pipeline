 920S. Virginia Beach, can you assign another ambulance? We had a minor altercation with another vehicle. Just hit a side mirror. Nobody's injured and no major damage to either party, but I just wanted to make sure we could collect information. 1225. And 920? 920, go ahead. What's your location? 920 is currently on General Booth Boulevard, right next to the Cheap Filet and before the Jam Neck exit. Okay. Virginia Beach, can you enter a PD case? And 920, advise what parking lot you guys end up going in? Yeah.
