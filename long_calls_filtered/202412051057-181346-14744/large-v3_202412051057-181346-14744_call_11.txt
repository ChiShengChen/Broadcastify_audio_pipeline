 Rescue 14, 924P for a medical alarm at 2309 Baltic Avenue. We have fall detection alert from pendant at 1218. 17 to ambulance 17, 23P. 17 to 23P, go ahead. Just FYI, we'll be in the campground. The gate should be open. When you come in the campground, just go right and go straight down. We're about halfway down. Copy that. Thank you. 18. Can you guys move up to 5 or 21, please? Thanks.
