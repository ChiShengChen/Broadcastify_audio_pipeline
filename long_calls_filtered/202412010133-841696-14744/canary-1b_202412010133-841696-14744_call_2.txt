I'll see if I can ask you, Bulls Bay command, I'll be located on the outside. Command, go ahead, it's seven. No signs of smoke are fire in the structure, all the alarms are going off because they're hard wired. I'm going to receive battalion three. Man, attic is clear, engine seven command. I'll receive attic clear and just how it's going to handle. I'll use command clear and click attack. Receive two is clear.
