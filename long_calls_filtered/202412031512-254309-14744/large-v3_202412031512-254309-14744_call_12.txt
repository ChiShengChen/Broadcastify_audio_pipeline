 Yeah, go ahead. I saw you added yourself. Did we clear another time from this? Yeah. No, she's still showing that man route. I told her to reassign the next glasses to the gas leak out in the 10th area. Call you if you want to get that. Engine 3 is on tag 4. And it's your roll call for Greta's court. Engine 3. Engine 3. Engine 2. Engine 2. Engine 20. Engine 1. Engine 8. Engine 8.51. Engage, on run. 16-22. 16-22. Battalion 1, I got you on site. Roll call complete. Battalion 2 to Battalion 1, to location. Presidential, past Selena. Roll call, Battalion 1. Battalion 1. 64, and the Boulevard Overpass. Write a copy. You want me to drop off and go on the gas leak then? Yeah, I'm saying, too, if you pick up the call in Fairfield, that'd be great.
