The accident is on sixty four headed towards Springfield. We are coming from two hundred and sixty four so we'll be coming up on it. Do you have a visual on a overturned vehicle eastbound sixty four at the twin bridges? I'm the six hundred forty sounds at the twin bridges overturned in the tree line. There's other vehicles on the right shoulder. So just confirm it is eastbound at twin bridges on the right shoulder. Correct. Pass twin bridges. Pretty much just that. Thank you. Copy. I'll be checking for victims.
