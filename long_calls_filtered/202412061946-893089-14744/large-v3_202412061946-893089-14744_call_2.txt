 Action is on 64 headed towards Greenbrier. 10-4. We are coming from 264, so we'll be coming up on it. Do you have a visual on an overturned vehicle eastbound 64 at the Twin Bridges? 64 eastbound just past Twin Bridges overturned in the tree line. There are several vehicles on the right shoulder. So, Jessica, for our immediate eastbound at Twin Bridges on the right shoulder, correct? Past Twin Bridges. Received just that. Thank you. Copy. It was one costume. All right. Rider 10 will be in command. It appears that I have one vehicle in the trees. I'll be checking. Four vehicles.
