Interior ladder eleven. We got one patient deceased in the kitchen. To investigate. Visual ladder eleven interior. We have one patient deceased. I'm on scene. Also in command. DFPD and I'm walking up now. Apartment building, this would be oil command. Have an actual leak inside. Still checking. Right now we got eleven on that COMI. Turn the stove off. Seeing it's not on scene. Can you go ahead and stage your direction to travel on oil so we confirm if there is any other leak aside from the stove that was already turned off.
