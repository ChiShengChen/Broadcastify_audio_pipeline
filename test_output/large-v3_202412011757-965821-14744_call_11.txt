Commander Ladder 2, what’s the status of primaries? I have a theory that the primary is on the right floor. I’ll update you shortly. Copy. Comment stated there’s possibly an occupant on oxygen interior. 19-20. We’re on fire. Second fire in extension. Inside the room, we’re going to start pulling some ceilings. We understand there’s still possibly one more individual in this area. You got it. You got over by where we’re parked? You guys in my site? We’re making patient contact. Be clear for us. Just stand by for a second. Will do. With everybody outside. Stand by for a second.
