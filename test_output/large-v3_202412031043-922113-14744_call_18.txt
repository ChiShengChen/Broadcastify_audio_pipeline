Yes sir, it's going to be a small fire due to a lawnmower backing over a leaf debris. Fire's out, Ladder 2 can handle you, clear all additional units. You're going to handle all these clear, you need the tech? Momentarily DLS to Peach, both units are accounts. All right. UMS Ruben, you're big. UMS 3. All UMS assets have been cleared from Hago, you've chosen Robo. All right. I am a student in Ambulance 422 for an injury from a fall 5656 Indian River Road Waffle House, Kingsville area at 12 a.m.
