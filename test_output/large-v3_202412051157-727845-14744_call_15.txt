Not operation, who’s on the kitchen? One, we’ve been dispatched up to I-264 East at exit 14P or I think before West report of a possible brush fire in the area. Give a visual on anything. Maybe so a dog on the interstate 264 West down he by exit 17B. A running loose on the interstate 264 West down he by exit 17B. Thank you.
