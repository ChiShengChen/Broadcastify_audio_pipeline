Interior ladder eleven. We got one patient deceased in the kitchen. So investigating. Copy, visual ladder ladder eleven interior. We have one patient deceased. I'm unseen. I'll see him come in. This will be oil command. Do we have an actual leak inside? We're still checking right now we got eleven on that COMEO. Copy. We just turned the stove off. Copy. All units that I'm seeing. Can you go ahead and stage your direction to travel on Oreo so we confirm if there is any other leak aside from the stove that was already turned off?
