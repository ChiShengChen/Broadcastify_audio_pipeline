Can you show me on five hundred and twenty p? We're double checking with the caller, but I have another prior from back in August. It says the code is three, five, four, one. I got it. We'll try three, five, four, one. It's just a light haze in the pool there. We checked all the mechanical room and fire control room on the first floor and just forced to get to the second floor and check out above it, but we haven't found anything yet. We're trying to find somebody here to see if they actually have good smoke or just lazy smoke. Right, engine one. Yeah, we're up in the mezzanine area. It's located in eight back, we're a killer of some kind. We got light smoke coming from it. It's not on fire at this time. We're going to isolate power to it and then we can handle with engine one and ladder one. Isolated the issue. Engine one and ladder one. Got rescue one coming inside too. All of the units can clear.
