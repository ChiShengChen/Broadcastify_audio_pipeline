Command Engine fourteen. East side, go ahead. Okay, that's what I was checking. Do we need to get another crew for the West side that was I've talked earlier? Geographically challenged, I'm on the West side. We're extending the line right now. I think we have adequate manpower this time. Okay, that's what I was checking. So you got the West side and then Engine eleven has the East side. I also have brush eight that just arrived on scene if you need them. Command Copper, command brush eight. Okay. Could you help me go face to face with you? Yeah, for that was what I was gonna request. Engine eleven command. Have engine agencies that need to brush truck along the railroad tracks so they can get a little bit further west and might be able to drop a line at the end over there? Yeah, just have brush eight and support eight here. It's volunteers. Get back in there.
