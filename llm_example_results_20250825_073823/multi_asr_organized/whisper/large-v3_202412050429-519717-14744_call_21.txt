Division 11, go ahead. I had one. I'm going to hail you. Contact three. Correct. 11, 10-1. Yeah, 10-4. Seeing what you got and what do you need. I got a homeless encampment behind a distribution center. I got about an acre burning right now. With the slight wind, I got Engine 14 coming to me and Brush 8 coming to me. That should be enough. We're setting up a garden lay right now, but I'm going to need some manpower. Okay, 10-4. I'll head that way to help you out.
