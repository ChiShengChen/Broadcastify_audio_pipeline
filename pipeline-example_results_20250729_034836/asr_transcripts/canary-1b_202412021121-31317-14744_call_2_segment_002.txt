Commander Engine eighteen, were you calling me? Negative, I was just talking to eighteen driver. Christie, I'm gonna dissolve command and leave the talk with you. Sounds good, thank you. Copy that engine for nine hundred twenty three, when you get on the bridge, you're gonna have to go all the way down the first tunnel, hang around before you go through the tunnel, drive all the way around, get headed back in the southbound direction. You'll see the accident on your left hand side as you pass.
