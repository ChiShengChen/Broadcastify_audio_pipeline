I'm going to do a face-to-face meeting. That was what I was going to request. Engine 11, command. Have Engine 8 see if they can get that brush truck along the railroad track so they can get a little bit further west. They might be able to drop a line at the end over there. Yeah, just have Brush 8 and Support 8 here as volunteers. We'll be right back in there.
