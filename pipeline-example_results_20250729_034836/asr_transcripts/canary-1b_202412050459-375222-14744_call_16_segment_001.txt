Okay. Could you help me go face to face with you? Yeah, for that was what I was gonna request. Engine eleven command. Have engine agencies that need to brush truck along the railroad tracks so they can get a little bit further west and might be able to drop a line at the end over there? Yeah, just have brush eight and support eight here. It's volunteers. Get back in there.
