Do you have an actual leak inside? We're still checking. Right now we've got 11 on the CO meter. Copy. We just turned the stove off. We're staging now on Oriole. Copy. All units not on scene. You can go ahead and stage your direction of travel on Oriole so we confirm if there is any other leak aside from the stove that was already turned off. Stage on the rescue.
