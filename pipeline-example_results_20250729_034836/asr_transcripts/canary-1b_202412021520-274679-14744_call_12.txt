Is it seven to ladder seven on tag four? Ladder seven? I'm not sure they've updated your case. These are still the same cases. So we have units on tag three and units on tag four. If you're in a good position, I can clear ladder sixteen. Yeah, I'm arriving now. Go ahead and clear ladder sixteen. Channels assigned to our call. Is that correct? We have tag three and four. It's because it was initially entered as two separate cases until we were able to confirm they were related. So if everyone wants to go to tag four, it's all the same accident. Okay, cover that. I appreciate it. I will let all the units on tag four know to switch tag three. Sorry, sixteen forty. Do you have enough manpower on them?
