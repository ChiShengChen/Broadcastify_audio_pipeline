Can I cover the two holes? Yeah, for I've got the two holes. I've got Amos four hundred and twenty two P available. One's gonna be all the way up near in the fourth precinct area, north, and then we got the four hundred forty North Lynn Haven. Now it's a maturity call at Kings Grand House. Four hundred twenty two can take North Lynn Haven. That should cover everything. Amos four hundred twenty two P, you're gonna be taking North Lynn Haven. Amos twenty two P will be taking Avery. Is that correct?
